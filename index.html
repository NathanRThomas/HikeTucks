                        <h2>What is "Tuckermans Ravine"?</h2><br/>
                        <p>Tuckermans Ravine (Tucks) is essentially a bowl, carved in the east facing side of Mt. Washington.
                        I believe technically it's a glacial cirque, meaning it was carved by glaciers and forms a half-cirle.
                        The top of the bowl is almost to the very top of the summit, probably only a few hunder yards away from the observatory, for
                        anyone that wants to ascend to the very top. While the bowl itself can be very steep in parts, over 50 degrees,
                        once you reach the top of the bowl, also known as the "snow fields", it's much more gradual, almost flat in some spots.
                        The "ravine" part of this is the bowl and the run-off below the bowl down the side of Washington, essentially the part
                        that's fun to ski.

                        <h2>Wait, what do you mean by "hike"?</h2><br/>
                        <p>Right, so there's no chair to bring you up here, it requires hiking.  You park down by the 
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/AMC+Pinkham+Notch+Visitor+Center/@44.2587727,-71.2489811,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x4cb391b438c3d74b:0xd7368b94f1f0d7a1!2sWildcat+Mountain!8m2!3d44.2640861!4d-71.239366!3m4!1s0x4cb3edf31ccea94b:0x6d52ee6e09c1c720!8m2!3d44.2575256!4d-71.2530085"
                            target="_blank">Pinkham Notch Visitor Center</a>.  If you're there early, you can park in their lot, otherwise you park on the road with the
                        rest of us.  This "entrance" to the trail head, is just down the road from Wildcat, just outside of Gorham NH.</p><br/><br/>
                        <h4>Part 1</h4><br/>
                        <p>From either the road or the parking lot, it's 2.5 hours if you're in really good shape, 3 hours if you're in good shape 
                        to the bottom of the bowl.  For this part you'll want a pair of good hiking boots, something that works in the snow.
                        You will not hike up in your ski boots.  Aside from a good pair of boots, the only other thing you'll <b>need</b> to do this 
                        is a backpack
                        that you can carry your skis/board on.  Like I said it's upwards of 3 hours, <b>You cannot carry your skis/board on your shoulders
                        that whole way</b>.  
                        The hike itself isn't <i>that</i> bad.  Yes it's uphill, but it's not like climbing stairs the whole way.  The path is pretty well
                        beaten, and wide enough for stops.  Also, you can skin up, I prefer not to as it's border-line for steepness for that, plus it's
                        well traveled enough you're almost never blazing a trail.  If you don't know what skinning is don't worry about it.<br/><br/>
                        You'll aslo want between 3 pints and 2 quarts of hydrating fluid for the hike, along with 1 to 2 pints of
                        non-hydrating fluid for hanging out at the top.  Also trail mix, granola bars, other hiking food is good.  Also, you'll probably
                        want something to eat up top for a "real" lunch, so pack a sandwich, or stop at subway in Gorham.<br/><br/>
                        My preferred setup:<br/>
                        You'll want something that you don't sweat too much in, I will usually wear my ski pants, with all the vents open, and then
                        a longsleve shirt and coat.  Obviously adjust to the current weather, but you'll want to wear something that you'd be cold in
                        if you weren't hiking.  I plan on changing my base shirt at the top cause it will be rather wet at that point.<br/>
                        I ski, so I will usually put a hand warmer in the toe of each of my boats, then shove a ski sock in each.  Helps to keep the boot
                        a little warmer on the hike.  Also a pint of beer fits rather well in a boot on top of the sock, just as a note.  If it's snowing
                        i will wrap each of my boots in a kitchen trash bag, so they stay dry for the hike.
                        I then mount my skis vertically on the back of my pack, and with my boots velcroed together hang them over my back, so there's a
                        boot on each side of the skis.  Seems to work pretty well to hike with like that.</p><br/><br/>
                        <h4>Part 2</h4><br/>
                        <p>Once you make it like that to the bottom of the bowl, you need to hike to the top, at least once, otherwise everyone will call you a pussy.  
                        At this point I will change base shirts, and bundle up a little more.  
                        You will also put your boots on, and leave anything at the base that you don't need to
                        ski, like that 12 pack of beer you're carrying.  Now, you can hike up wherever, and you'll see people doing that, but i wouldn't 
                        recommend following the lemmings.  You'll want to hike up on the right side, by line 9 from the photo.  Like I said, a the top of
                        the bowl is the snow fields, if you make it up there, you can walk/skate around where ever you want to after, but you should
                        take the easiest way up.<br/><br/>
                        This part can take 45 to 1 hour for a full hike up and ski down to the bottom of the bowl.  I will typically do 2 full runs from
                        the top on a trip.  Heros can do 3.  Another tip is to only ski half way down the bowl, the top is the most fun anyway, and then hike back up from there for a second full run</p>

                        <h2>Can I die?</h2><br />
                        <p>So... we're going to try to avoid that.  It is dangerous, and early April is about the earliest you'd want to hike up.
                        It really comes down to the weather, temperature, wind, and the avalanche warnings.  Ya, avalanche warnings.  I like 
                        <a href="http://www.mountwashingtonavalanchecenter.org/" target="_blank">this site</a> 
                        for information and updates on the ravine.  I will be checking this a few days before, 
                        if it looks like there's still avalanche warnings, or if they're projecting high winds, or sub-zero temperatures, we'll
                        postpone the hike til later.  I'll update this site if things change, so feel free to check back here before driving.</p>

                        <h2>Why would anyone do this?</h2><br />
                        <p>Good question, why does anyone really do anything...<br/>
                        So, if you could design a bowl, this would be it.  Over 180 degrees to the bowl, giving you upwards of 10 lines down.
                        Also, because of the snow fields above the bowl, the winds pull the snow from up there into the bowl.  So the snow is always
                        deep and stays until July.  I prefer this bowl over any that I've skied, the size, openess, and options for lines down is just
                        special</p>

                        <p>Alissa, Brooklyn and I will be staying at the <a href="https://www.northconwaygrand.com/" target="_blank">North Conway Grand Hotel</a>
                            Friday and Saturday April 27 and 28.  It's about a 30 mintue drive from there. This gives us the option to ski Saturday or Sunday.
                            I'm going to go with Saturday the 28 for now.  Obviously this can change based on conditions on the mountain.
                            My goal is to get there ~ 9:00am.  Be at the top by 12pm, ski down to the car by 3pm or so.  Also then to drink beer in North Conway that night.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Anyone who's interested let me know and we'll wait for you at the parking lot. - This is just a no pressure invite for anyone who's interested.
                        <br/><br/>
                        There's a lot of other hotels around for anyone wanting a shorter commute that morning.

                        <h2>What if I'm not a good enough skier?</h2><br />
                        <p>I would say that anyone who can ski White Heat can find a line down from the top of the bowl that they like.
                        Also, you never have to hike higher than you want to ski down.  The lines start at the top of the bowl, but you're more than
                        welcome to hike part way up the bowl and ski down from there.  Honestly the biggest concern when skiing tucks insn't your
                        skiing ability, it's if you're in good enough shape to hike up a snowy mountain for 3 hours.<br/><br/>
                        ALSO: I forgot to mention, you don't have to hike down, you get to ski it.  Depending on the snow and how early in the season you
                        go, you can ski back to your car.  I would say that the run down from the bottom of the bowl is an easy black diamond.  
                        It's ungroomed, obviously, and does get moguls on it, but otherwise it's decently wide for the most part, and not overly steep.
                        It's not the way you hiked up, but it's about the same steepness. </p>
